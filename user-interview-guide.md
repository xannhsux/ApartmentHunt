## Core Interview Questions

### Current Experience & Pain Points

   * *Probe: How long did the process take from initial search to signing a lease?*
   * *Probe: What was most frustrating about the experience?*

2. **Which apartment hunting app or website did you rely on most heavily, and why did you prefer it over others?**
   * *Probe: What specific features made it your go-to choice?*

3. **When using [specific app they mentioned], what was the biggest challenge you faced in communicating your apartment requirements?**
   * *Probe: Were there any requirements you couldn't easily search for?*

4. **How accurately did the search results match what you were actually looking for?**
   * *Probe: Can you estimate what percentage of listings shown to you were actually relevant to your needs?*

6. **How did you keep track of apartments you were interested in during your search?**
   * *Probe: Did you use the app's saving features or external tools like spreadsheets?*

### Requirements Expression

7. **What were your non-negotiable requirements in your apartment search? How easy or difficult was it to filter for these specific needs in the apps you used?**
   * *Probe: Were there any requirements you couldn't search for directly?*

8. **If you could have described your perfect apartment to a knowledgeable real estate agent who understood all your needs, what would you have said?**
   * *Note: Pay close attention to natural language and specific criteria mentioned*

9. **How did you search for subjective qualities like "quiet neighborhood" or "lots of natural light" using the tools available to you?**
   * *Probe: Did you find workarounds for searching these qualities?*

10. **When you were using [competing app], did you ever wish you could just type or speak your full requirements instead of using all the different filters and options? Why or why not?**

### Decision-Making Factors

11. **Beyond the basic information (price, bedrooms, location), what additional details were most important in helping you decide whether to view an apartment?**

12. **How much time did you typically spend filtering and scrolling through listings before finding ones worth contacting?**
    * *Probe: Did this feel like a good use of your time?*

    * *Probe: Did the apps provide sufficient neighborhood information?*

### Communication & Scheduling

14. **Once you found apartments you were interested in, how did you go about scheduling viewings?**
    * *Probe: What was frustrating about this process?*

15. **How responsive were property managers or landlords when you contacted them through the app?**
    * *Probe: Would you have preferred other communication methods?*

### Feature Evaluation

16. **If an app could understand complex apartment requirements expressed in your own words (like "I need a quiet, north-facing one-bedroom with a den under $3500 in downtown LA"), how valuable would that be to you on a scale of 1-10? Why?**

17. **What other features would make your ideal apartment hunting app? What's missing from current options?**

18. **Would you be willing to pay a small fee for an app that significantly reduced your apartment hunting time and found more accurate matches? If yes, how much?**

### Closing Questions

19. **If you had to search for an apartment again tomorrow, what would you do differently based on your previous experience?**

20. **Is there anything else about your apartment hunting experience that we haven't covered that you think would be helpful for us to know?**
